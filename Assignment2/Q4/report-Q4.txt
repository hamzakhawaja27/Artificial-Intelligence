Logistics-LNS.py Optimizes all cases. Sometimes the program runs for more than 120secs. but it continually shows the current best solution on the terminal with the time taken to extract it.

The logisticsQ4-4-3 case converges within 5secs
The logisticsQ4-6-3 case converges within a min
The logisticsQ4-12-4 doesnot converge but improves significantly
The logisticsQ4-21-8 doesnot converge but improves significantly

Algorithm works recursively
In each iteration, the values for one of the trucks become constraints for the next iteration.
e.g
iteration 1: new constraints: All values of solution[truck=1,x,y] from previous iteration become constraints. and then a new solution is found.

Once we have limited single truck solution values. We move on to restricting 2 at a time and then 3 and it goes on like this till time lapses.
